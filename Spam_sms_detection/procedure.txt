
Spam Detection using Machine Learning

This project implements a spam detection system using various machine learning models. It preprocesses text messages, vectorizes them using TF-IDF, and then applies different classifiers like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM. Additionally, it balances the dataset using SMOTE to improve the performance of the models.

Steps:

1. Download required package using pip command using 
   !pip install <package> #Reference

2. Mount Google Drive (when using colab)
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive', force_remount=True)

3. Data preprocessing

   Convert to lowercase: Ensures uniformity.
   Remove punctuation: Strips out any punctuation.
   Remove numbers: Eliminates digits from the text.
   Remove stop words: Removes common words that do not contribute much to root meaning.
   Lemmatization: Reduces words to their root form

4. Balancing the dataset between spam and ham using oversampling/undersampling technique

5. Model Training
     * In question mentioned classifier--> Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     * The Training dataset(80:20) is balanced using SMOTE to improve model performance

6. Prediction
     * The Trained Model are ready to predict whether a given message by user is spam or not and display the classification report of the model

7. GUI Creating using voila 
	Interact with the widget
		*Enter a message in the text input box.
		*Select a model from the dropdown.
		*Click the "Predict" button to see the prediction and the classification report.
