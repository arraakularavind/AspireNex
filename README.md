# Project 1: Credit Card Fraud Detection
    #Overview
          #This project aims to build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By experimenting with various machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests, we classify transactions as either fraudulent or legitimate.

    #About Dataset
        #The dataset contains information about credit card transactions, including features like transaction amount, transaction time, and other relevant transaction details.

    #Module Requirement:
        #Python 3.x
        #pandas
        #numpy
        #scikit-learn
        #imbalanced-learn
        #voila
        #tabulate
        #drive
    
    #General Procedure:
        #Load and preprocess the dataset.
        #Split the data into training and testing sets.
        #Train the model using different algorithms.
        #Evaluate the model performance.

    #Result
        #Presenting the performance metrics of each model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Include visualizations tables for classification Report for both fraud and valid Transaction

# Project 2: SMS Spam Classification
       #Overview
            #This project focuses on building an AI model to classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate. Techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings are used with classifiers such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines.

      #About Dataset
            #The dataset contains SMS messages labeled as spam or legitimate (ham).
      #Module Requirement
           #Python 3.x
           #pandas
           #numpy
           #scikit-learn
           #imbalanced-learn
           #voila
           #tabulate
           #drive
           #nltk (Natural Language toolkit)

      #General Procedure:
            #Load and preprocess the dataset.
            #Split the data into training and testing sets.
            #Vectorize the text data using TF-IDF.
            #Train the model using different classifiers.
            #Evaluate the model performance.
      #Result
            #Provide the performance metrics of each model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score based on input provided by user (Message) and classify them as either spam or ham

NOTE: DETAILED WORKING PROCEDURE has been given in "procedure.txt" of respective folder with working model and a recorded demonstration has been provided for every models and functions to experience the same.
